- question: Why are there only 13 DNS root servers?
  answer: |
    The UDP maximum packet size of 512 bytes did not allow for more in the early days of the internet.
    To fit all 13 addresses in the packet, compression is used.
- question: Describe a recursive DNS query
  answer: |
    "Give me what I need and ask everyone you want"
- question: Describe an iterative DNS query
  answer: |
    "Give me what you know but ask no one else"
- question: When do wildcards not apply?
  answer: |
    When the query is in another zone.
    Delegation cancels the wildcard defaults.
- question: Whats the value for the label type of a compressed label?
  answer: |
    11.
    The first two bits of the length bytes contain the label type.
- question: Explain how label compression works
  answer: |
    Label type: 11.
    6+8 bits used as pointer from DNS packet offset to domain.
    Saves space if a domain name appears more than once.
