- question: Why are there only 13 DNS root servers?
  answer: |
    The UDP maximum packet size of 512 bytes did not allow for more in the early days of the internet.
    To fit all 13 addresses in the packet, compression is used.
- question: Describe a recursive DNS query
  answer: |
    "Give me what I need and ask everyone you want"
- question: Describe an iterative DNS query
  answer: |
    "Give me what you know but ask no one else"
- question: When do wildcards not apply?
  answer: |
    When the query is in another zone.
    Delegation cancels the wildcard defaults.
- question: Whats the value for the label type of a compressed label?
  answer: |
    11.
    The first two bits of the length bytes contain the label type.
- question: Explain how label compression works
  answer: |
    Label type: 11.
    6+8 bits used as pointer from DNS packet offset to domain.
    Saves space if a domain name appears more than once.

    ```The source of synthesis of a query name,
    is the domain name "*.<closest encloser>",
    which may or may not exist.```

    Which system does not use TCP?
    a) DNS Crypt
    b) DOD
    c) DoH
    d) DoT

    b) _tcp.example.com.
    c) example.com.
    d) com.
    e) .

  answer: It allows overloading hosts for an IP address. Root servers can therefore be replicated all over the world (see INR for more details)

- question: How does a resolver announce itself as a full-service (non-stub) resolver?
  answer: It sets the Recursion Allowed (RA) flag

- question: Why is .os3.nl illegal in DNS?

- question: How would you implement delegation for 192.0.8.0/22? Is this possible for prefixes /24 to /32? Explain why.
  answer: |
    ```
    $ORIGIN 0.192.in-addr-arpa.
    8/22 NS ns.slack-22-holder.example.com
    8 DNAME 8.8/22
    9 DNAME 9.8/22
    10 DNAME 10.8/22
    11 DNAME 11.8/22

    $ORIGIN 8/22.0.192.in-addr-arpa.
    33.9 PTR somehost.slash-22-holder.example.com
      ```

    This isn't possible for /24 and /32 networks. We could use CNAMEs instead

- question: What does SOA stand for? What does it do?
  answer: A Start Of Authority record administrates important zone parameters

- question: What's the purpose of the serial number in an SOA record?
  answer: Usually formatted as YYYMMDDnn It allows for versioning of the data

- question: Can a SOA have a 0 TTL?
  answer: yes

- question: What are the different interpretations of SOA's Minimum field?
  answer: |
    It meant the minimal TTL allowed but was never used this way, instead:
      BIND8 uses it as the default TTL
      BIND9 uses it as the TTL for caching negative replies

- question: Do RRSIG RRs form a resource record set?
  answer: No because all RRs in an RRSET must have the same TTL

- question: |
    Which one is used in DNS? Why is this an issue?
    [!dns tree pic](./files/images/dnstree.png)

    node -> node is used
    node -> edge would have made the parent/child delegation of authority easier
