- question: Define the NEC
  answer: |
    The next closer is the child of the closest encloser on the graph to the non existing domain.
- question: Explain the security implications of using NSEC wildcards
  answer: |
    Invalidates NSEC semantics.
    Example: *.example.com. has an NSEC to anything.example.com.
    Wildcard synthesis would generate an NSEC record:
    !.example.com -> anything.example.com.
- question: Which RFC discusses wildcard semantics?
  answer: |
    RFC #4592
- question: Is it allowed to use a DNAME record in combination with a wildcard?
  answer: |
    No. According to RFC #4592 this is uncoherent and to be avoided.
- question: Is it allowed to use a CNAME record in combination with a wildcard?
  answer: |
    Yes. According to RFC #4592 this is allowed.
- question: Is it allowed to use a SOA record in combination with a wildcard?
  answer: |
    Allowed, but strange according to RFC #4592.
- question: What are the different security statuses of RRs?
  answer: |
    1. secure
    2. insecure
    3. bogus
    4. indeterminate
- question: What does the AD flag indicate?
  answer: |
    Authentic Data.
    Set from recursive name server to stub resolver, to indicate the response data has been verified successfully.
    However, client implementations usually verify the result themselves.
- question: What does the CD flag indicate?
  answer: |
    Checking Disabled.
    Set from the stub resolver to the recursive name server, to indicate that the client wants to do the checking by itself.
- question: What does the DO flag indicate?
  answer: |
    DNSSEC OK.
    Indicates that the client want to retrieve all DNSSEC related information:
    RRSIG and NSEC(3) records etc...
- question: Which wildcard types should not be synthesized?
  answer: |
    - SOA
    - NS
    - DNAME
    - NSEC
- question: What is the maximum value for QDCOUNT and why?
  answer: |
    There is only a single response code in the DNS protocol header.
    That makes it unclear how to correctly answer queries for multiple domains.
- question: The digest in the text representation of a DS record uses which encoding?
  answer: |
    Hex encoding
- question: What information is signed with the KSK?
  answer: |
    The DNSKEYs.
- question: What information is signed with the ZSK?
  answer: |
    All resource record sets except the DNSKEYs.
- question: A NS record is signed by whom?
  answer: |
    The child.
- question: A DS record set is signed by whom?
  answer: |
    The parent.
- question: The label in an NSEC3 record encoded in what encoding and why?
  answer: |
    Base32, because of case sensitivity.
    It is shorter than base16 (hex) but longer than base64.
- question: Denial of Existence needs at most how many NSEC records?
  answer: |
    1 without wildcards.
    2 with wildcards.
- question: Whats the role of the CLE when querying for a non-existent domain?
  answer: |
    The CLE is the parent of both NEC and SOS.
- question: Which records apart from NSEC and RRSIG are present at a delegation point?
  answer: |
    DS record
    NS record (even for insecure delegations)
- question: |
    Which list is in lexicographic ordering?
    a) *a, a, ~a
    b) *a, ~a, a
    c) a, *a, ~a
    d) a, ~a, *a
    e) ~a, *a, a
  answer: |
    a) because:
    * is placed before letters
    ~ is placed after letters
    in the ASCII table.
- question: Denial of Existence needs at most how many NSEC3 records?
  answer: |
    2 normally,
    3 in some cases.
- question: The Type in an NSEC resource record applies to?
  answer: |
    The owner of the NSEC resource record (aka the source).
- question: What is the meaning of the DS resource record?
  answer: |
    The Delegation Signer record is used to secure DNSSEC delegations.
    It contains the hash of the KSK from the sub-delegated zone.
- question: A ZSK signs?
  answer: |
    All RR sets.
- question: A KSK signs?
  answer: |
    The DNSKEYs.

- question: How often should KSKs be replaced?
  answer: |
    Annually.
- question: How often should ZSKs be replaced?
  answer: |
    Quarterly.
- question: Explain the contents of the DS record
  answer: |
    Delegation Signer.
    Contains a hash of the public KSK.
- question: Define ZSK
  answer: |
    Used to sign or verify a domains / zones non-key records.
- question: Define KSK
  answer: |
    Used to sign or verify a domains / zones keys.

- question: Where in the zone is the NSEC3PARAM RR defined?
  answer: Apex

- question: Why is there no NSECPARAM RR type?
  answer: NSEC does not use a salt and does not sign empty non terminals.

- question: What kind of protection does DNSSEC offer with respect to confidentiality, integrity and authenticity?
  answer: Integrity and Authenticity

- question: What is the name of the attack on DNS where the DNS transactions IDs are guessed?
  answer: Kaminsky attack

- question: When does a domain name exist?
  answer:  A domain name exists if the name itslef or any of its descendants have a least 1 RR

- question: How would you define an ENT in NSEC terms?
  answer: A domain name D that is covered by some NSEC records with source S and target T is an ENT iif D is an ancestor of T in the domain name tree

- question: How would you prove NoData for an ENT with NSEC?
  answer: If the domain has an ancestor with an TON NSEC record that covers it

- question: Why doesn't an NSEC3 record contain NSEC3 in its type list?
  answer: because the types refer to the original (non-hashed) domain name

- question: Does an NSEC record contain the NSEC in its type bitmap?
  answer: Yes!

- question: What hashing algorithms can be used in a DS record digest?
  answer: SHA1 & SHA256

- question: What RRsets are not signed by RRSIGS?
  answer: Glue RRsets & NS RRsets at delegation points

- question: Even with DNSSEC, what can you spoof?
  answer: DNS flags & response codes

- question: When was DNSSEC created? In what RFC?
  answer: 1997 & RFC 2065

  answer: Secure, Insecure, Bogus, Indeterminate

- question: A query with the DO flag set always has ARCOUNT > 0. Explain why
  answer: |
    There is no DO flag in the classic DNS flags.
    The pseudo opt type 41 has place in its TTL field for the DO flag.
