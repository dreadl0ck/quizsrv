- question: Define the NEC
  answer: |
    The next closer is the child of the closest encloser on the graph
    to the non existing domain.
- question: Explain the security implications of using NSEC wildcards
  answer: |
    Invalidates NSEC semantics.
    Example: *.example.com. has an NSEC to anything.example.com.
    Wildcard synthesis would generate an NSEC record:
    !.example.com -> anything.example.com.
- question: Which RFC discusses wildcard semantics?
  answer: |
    RFC #4592
- question: Is it allowed to use a DNAME record in combination with a wildcard?
  answer: |
    No. According to RFC #4592 this is uncoherent and to be avoided.
- question: Is it allowed to use a CNAME record in combination with a wildcard?
  answer: |
    Yes. According to RFC #4592 this is allowed.
- question: Is it allowed to use a SOA record in combination with a wildcard?
  answer: |
    Allowed, but strange according to RFC #4592.
- question: What are the different security statuses of RRs?
  answer: |
    1. secure
    2. insecure
    3. bogus
    4. indeterminate
- question: What does the AD flag indicate?
  answer: |
    Authentic Data.
    Set from recursive name server to stub resolver,
    to indicate the response data has been verified successfully.
    However, client implementations usually verify the result themselves.
- question: What does the CD flag indicate?
  answer: |
    Checking Disabled.
    Set from the stub resolver to the recursive name server,
    to indicate that the client wants to do the checking by itself.
- question: What does the DO flag indicate?
  answer: |
    DNSSEC OK.
    Indicates that the client want to retrieve all DNSSEC related information:
    RRSIG and NSEC(3) records etc...
- question: Which wildcard types should not be synthesized?
  answer: |
    - SOA
    - NS
    - DNAME
    - NSEC
- question: What is the maximum value for QDCOUNT and why?
  answer: |
    There is only a single response code in the DNS protocol header.
    That makes it unclear how to correctly answer queries for multiple domains.
- question: The digest in the text representation of a DS record uses which encoding?
  answer: |
    Hex encoding
- question: What information is signed with the KSK?
  answer: |
    The DNSKEYs.
- question: What information is signed with the ZSK?
  answer: |
    All resource record sets except the DNSKEYs.
- question: A NS record is signed by whom?
  answer: |
    The child.
- question: A DS record set is signed by whom?
  answer: |
    The parent.
- question: The label in an NSEC3 record encoded in what encoding and why?
  answer: |
    Base32, because of case sensitivity.
    It is shorter than base16 (hex) but longer than base64.
- question: Denial of Existence needs at most how many NSEC records?
  answer: |
    1 without wildcards.
    2 with wildcards.
- question: Whats the role of the CLE when querying for a non-existent domain?
  answer: |
    The CLE is the parent of both NEC and SOS.
- question: Which records apart from NSEC and RRSIG are present at a delegation point?
  answer: |
    DS record
    NS record (even for insecure delegations)
- question: |
    Which list is in lexicographic ordering?
    a) *a, a, ~a
    b) *a, ~a, a
    c) a, *a, ~a
    d) a, ~a, *a
    e) ~a, *a, a
  answer: |
    a) because:
    * is placed before letters
    ~ is placed after letters
    in the ASCII table.
- question: Denial of Existence needs at most how many NSEC3 records?
  answer: |
    2 normally,
    3 in some cases.
- question: The Type in an NSEC resource record applies to?
  answer: |
    The owner of the NSEC resource record (aka the source).
- question: What is the meaning of the DS resource record?
  answer: |
    The Delegation Signer record is used to secure DNSSEC delegations.
    It contains the hash of the KSK from the sub-delegated zone.
- question: A ZSK signs?
  answer: |
    All RR sets.
- question: A KSK signs?
  answer: |
    The DNSKEYs.

- question: How often should KSKs be replaced?
  answer: |
    Annually.
- question: How often should ZSKs be replaced?
  answer: |
    Quarterly.
- question: Explain the contents of the DS record
  answer: |
    Delegation Signer.
    Contains a hash of the public KSK.
- question: Define ZSK
  answer: |
    Used to sign or verify a domains / zones non-key records.
- question: Define KSK
  answer: |
    Used to sign or verify a domains / zones keys.
