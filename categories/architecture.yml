  answer: Complex Instruction Set Computer

- question: Why have CISC architectures been invented?
  answer: |
    To combat the major bottleneck of CPU operations: memory access.
    Multiplication on RISC for example, requires a combination of multiple arithmetic operations, leading to multiple memory accesses.
    CISC provides dedicated instructions for multiplication, allowing optmization on the CPU.

- question: Name a drawback of RISC architectures
  answer: |
    The burden of complexity is placed on software.
    For example, RISC did not provide an instruction for multiplication.
    The operation had to be synthesized by software, combining multiple primitive operations.

- question: Name a drawback of RISC architectures in regard to memory usage
  answer: |
    RISC architectures require more memory on average,
    because operations that do not exist in the instruction set (e.g. multiplication) have to be synthesized by software.

- question: Name the design goals of a CISC instruction set
  answer: |
    - less memory use
    - more complex, but less instructions
    - orthogonal instruction set

    syscall         ; make syscall

- question: How would you exit your IA-32 program with exit code 0 using assembly?
