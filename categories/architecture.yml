- question: Explain indexed memory addressing
  answer: |
    Operand is a base memory address to which the value in the index register is added.

  answer: |
    Pushes the return (pc = program counter) address onto the stack
    and then jumps to the specified address.

    The .interp section contains the DLLs.
- question: Whats the entry point of an ELF executable?
  answer: |
    _start
- question: The x86 ISA does not make use of which addressing mode?
  answer: |
    The memory indirect addressing.
    Using pointers to pointers is inffecient,
    because it leads to two fetch operations for a single instruction.
- question: When compiling on a 64bit machine for 32bit architecture, the use of %rax in assembly causes?
  answer: |
    Compilation will fail, %rax does not exists on 32bit.
- question: What does pty stand for?
  answer: |
    pseudo terminal
- question: Starting an SSH session in an xterm window involves how many ptys?
  answer: |
    2 - one local and one remote pseudo terminal.
- question: Which system call is considered a quick hack?
  answer: |
    vfork - fork is computationally expensive because it copies all resources.
    clone is the proper replacement.
- question: Which step is not part of compilation?
  answer: |
    Loading of dynamic libraries - happens at runtime.
- question: What parts of an ELF file are used during runtime?
  answer: |
    Segments
- question: Whats the name of the executable file format used by Linux?
  answer: |
    ELF

- question: How many Microsoft engineers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
  answer: None. They just define darkness as an industry standard.
- question: How many Macintosh engineers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
  answer: None - it has to be done by a local authorized dealer.

- question: Name the syscalls used by a shell that executes a command in correct order.
  answer: |
    stat, fork, execve
- question: Name the path for the first device corresponding to the slave side of a pseudo terminal.
  answer: |
    /dev/pts/0
- question: Whats the master side of a pseudo terminal?
  answer: |
    /dev/ptmx
- question: Physical Address Extension (PAE) extends the possible memory space to?
  answer: |
    64 GiB
- question: Intel 8086 Segmentation can address?
  answer: |
    0x10FFF0 memory addresses.
    0x10FFEF (max addr space) + 1 (counting starts at zero).
- question: The ARM architecture belongs to the category?
  answer: |
    RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)
- question: When the kernel starts an application, which values are pushed to the stack?
  answer: |
    1. Argument Vector
    2. Environment
    3. Auxiliary Vector
    TODO: verify order, Karst said things are pushed in reverse order?
- question: Whats the entrypoint in crt1.o of an ELF executable?
  answer: |
    _start
    crt is the c runtime.
- question: What are the 4 steps involved in compilation?
  answer: |
    1. Preprocessing
    2. Compilation (=AST generation)
    3. Assembly Generation
    4. Linking
- question: The vDSO is part of what?
  answer: |
    It's part of the auxiliary vector.
- question: When was the x86 instruction set created?
  answer: |
    2003 by AMD
- question: What are the different memory addressing modes?
  answer: |
    - immidiate
    - register direct / indirect
    - memory direct / indirect
    - indexed

- question: Name the signature in the last two bytes of the MBR in hex
  answer: 0xAA55

- question: What are the last 4 bits of the MBR?
  answer: 1010

- question: What system call does the shell use to ensure the executed command wont end up as a zombie?
  answer: wait

- question: How is a process called that is reclaimed by init after the parent exited?
  answer: Orphan
- question: How is a process called that exited without the parent process reading its exit status?
  answer: Zombie

- question: What new register was introduced in the Intel 8080, compared to the 8008?
  answer: The internal 7-level push-down call stack of the 8008 was replaced by a dedicated 16-bit stack-pointer (SP) register.

- question: What is PSE?
  answer: A feature of x86 processors that extends the physical memory addressing capabilities from 32 bits to 36 bits, allowing addressing to up to 64 GB of memory.

- question: How much physical memory can be adressed with PAE, but without PSE?
  answer: |
    PAE allows for page table entries of 64 bits each instead of 32.
    Therefore 2^64 bytes of physical memory can be addressed.
