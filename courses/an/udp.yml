- question: What does RBUDP stand for?
  answer: Reliable Blast UDP

- question: What does UDT stand for?
  answer: UDP-based Data Transfer protocol

- question: Briefly describe how RBUDP works
  answer: |
    1) Blast (transmission) phase
      - sender sends entire payload via UDP at user-specified rate
      - receiver keepts track of received packets
    2) Synchronization phase
      - sender send DONE message via TCP
      - receiver send ACK with list of received packets
      - repeat blast until no missing data

- question: Which features are provided by SCTP?
  answer: |
    - Multi homing: increased resilience to network failures
    - Multiple streams between endpoints
    - Bundle of message in one packet to increase performance
    - Security features against flooding and other attacks
