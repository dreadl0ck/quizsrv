  answer: RTP Control Protocol

- question: What is RTCP used for?
  answer: |
    Management protocol for RTP that allows endpoints to exchange information about data flows.
    Used by RTP to determine how to tune its behavior.

- question: What functionality is provided by RTCP?
  answer: |
    - Media syncronization
    - QoS reports
    - Participation reports
    - Participation details

- question: What is the RTCP traffic limited to when the number of participants increases?
  answer: Typically to 5% of the session bandwidth.

- question: Name the RTCP message types
  answer: |
    - SDES: Sender Descriptor
    - BYE: Exit
    - SR: Sender Report
    - RR: Receiver Report
    - APP: Application

- question: What is a CDN?
  answer: |
    Content Delivery Network.
    A collection of network elements arranged for more effective delivery of content to end users.

- question: What types of content outsourcing do exist?
  answer: |
    - cooperative push-based
    - non cooperative pull based
    - cooperative pull-based

- question: What is "Surrogate Placement" in the context of content delivery?
  answer: Selection of surrogates to efficiently facilitate content delivery.

- question: What are benefits of video conferencing?
  answer: |
    - Reduced travel costs
    - Easier access to remote experts
    - More personal than a voice conference

- question: Name three VoIP signaling protocols?
  answer: |
    - SIP
    - H.323
    - Skype

- question: What does VoIP stand for?
  answer: Voice over IP

- question: What is the purpose of signaling protocols?
  answer: To provide all information needed to setup, control and teardown of VoIP calls.

- question: Which transport protocols are used to transport signaling messages for VoIP protocols?
  answer: TCP and UDP

- question: What problems occur when transporting audio data over a network connection?
  answer: No constant rate guarantees can be made.

- question: What is the classic mechanism for content delivery in networks?
  answer: Client-server model. Server holds content, client requests content, downloads it and can then play it.

- question: What are requirements for the client-server model for content delivery?
  answer: |
    - Timestamping
    - Indication of packet loss
    - Identification of clients
    - Good use of bandwidth

- question: What is the core idea of streaming video data?
  answer: |
    Server sends video frames at a fixed rate.
    Even though these will arrive delayed at the client, the rate will not change.

- question: What are the four sources of packet delay?
  answer: |
    - Nodal processing
    - Queueing
    - Transmission
    - Propagation

- question: What is the most common bottleneck for transferring data over a network?
  answer: Queueing delay.

- question: What does client-side buffering and playout delay try to compensate?
  answer: Network added delay and delay jitter.

- question: What is delay loss?
  answer: IP datagram arrives too late for playout at receiver.

- question: What is the typical maximum tolerable delay?
  answer: 150ms

- question: What is network loss?
  answer: IP datagram lost due to network congestion (router buffer overflow).

- question: What is loss tolerance?
  answer: Depending on voice encoding, losses concealed, packet loss rates between 1% and 10% can be tolerated.

- question: How do participants in an RTP session reduce overhead as the number of conference participants increases?
  answer: They reduce RTCP traffic, typically makes up for 5% of the session bandwidth.

- question: What is _adaptive bit rate streaming_?
  answer: Technique for dynamically adjusting the compression level and video quality of a stream to match bandwidth availability.

- question: What was the _old_ thinking on Streaming over HTTP?
  answer: |
    - TCP hurts multimedia transmission
    - We need buffering (a-la RTP)
    - Push methods (content pushed from server to client)

- question: What are _new_ insights on Streaming over HTTP?
  answer: |
    - TCP passes more easily through firewalls and NATs
    - TCP congestion control does not hurt clients if they can adapt to bandwidth variations
    - Pull methods (client controls speed of receival)

- question: What is a progressive download?
  answer: Treats video as a regular file and starts to play it as soon enough data has been received.

- question: What are the two key concepts for CDN organization?
  answer: |
    - Overlay approach
    - Network approach

- question: Which types of CDN servers do exist?
  answer: |
    - Origin server: stores the definitive version of a resource
    - Replica server (or surrogate server): stores resource copy

- question: What is the responsibility of a request routing system?
  answer: Responsible for routing client requests to an appropriate surrogate server for the delivery of content.

- question: What types of request routing algorithms do exist?
  answer: |
    - Adaptive
    - Non adaptive

- question: Name three request routing mechanisms
  answer: |
    - DNS-based request routing
    - HTTP redirection
    - URL Rewriting

- question: Is the closest server always the best one to serve the request?
  answer: No, it might have a bad latency because it is currently under heavy use!

- question: How can the performance be measured for a CDN?
  answer: |
    - Cache hit ratio should be high
    - Reserved bandwidth
    - Latency
    - Surrogate server load
