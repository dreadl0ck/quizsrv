- question: What is _Content Centric Networking_ and who introduced it?
  answer: |
    The _original_ internet was primarily about sharing resources.
    The _current_ Internet is about accessing content.
    Introduced by Van Jacobson in 2006.

- question: What is the goal of _Information Centric Networking_?
  answer: |
    The goal is to decouple information from its sources, by means of a clea location-identity split: name identifies content and not its location.

- question: Which problem is solved by ICN?
  answer: |
    The problem of flash crowds.
    It exploits in-network storage (caches) and in-network information awareness to optimally select location.

- question: What is a benefit of ICN?
  answer: Allows for mobile users, by defining a publish-subscribe model for expressing availability of content and interest in the content.

- question: Which guarantee is provided by ICN?
  answer: Guarantees that a receiver will only get content it requested.

- question: Which types of packets do exist in ICN?
  answer: |
    - Interest packets
    - Data packets

- question: What are the components of an _interest_ packet in ICN?
  answer: |
    - Name
    - Selectors (order preference, filters)
    - Nonce
    - Guiders (scope, interest lifetime)

- question: What are the components of a _data_ packet in ICN?
  answer: |
    - Name
    - MetaInfo (content type, validity period)
    - Content
    - Signature

- question: What does NDN stand for?
  answer: Named Data Networking

- question: What are the three core components of the NDN router architecture?
  answer: |
    - Content Store
    - Pending Interest Table (PIT)
    - FIB (Forwarding Information Base)

- question: What is _Named Data Networking_?
  answer: It's a proposed Future Internet architecture, that is used to investigate the evolution from today's host-centric network architecture IP to a data-centric network architecture (NDN).

- question: How is data integrity provided in _Named Data Networking_?
  answer: Data is digitally signed.

- question: What does SCION stand for?
  answer: Scalability, Control and Isolation On Next-Generation Networks

- question: What was the montivation for SCION?
  answer: The Internet is network of networks, 'glued together' by BGP, which does not provide any security by default.

- question: Briefly describe how SCION works
  answer: |
    - Replaces BGP and IP in the inter-domain context
    - Does not affect infrastructure and network protocls within an AS
    - Local trust anchors enable flexible trust relationships and prevent attacks from the outside
    - Verifiable: security proofs through formal methods

- question: Explain the notion of SCIONs Isolation Domains
  answer: |
    ISDs are SCIONs approach for scalability, fault isolation and sovereignity.
    Isolation Domains are groupings of ASes, ISD core ASes manage the ISD and provide global connectivity.

- question: How do Isolation Domains improve the scalability of the routing protocol?
  answer: Routing processes can be separated into an intra-ISD and an inter-ISD process.

- question: What does TRC stand for?
  answer: Trust Root Configuration

- question: How do ISDs enable heterogenous trust and network security?
  answer: |
    - Every ISD defines their own trust roots in a _Trust Root Confiugration_ (TRC)
    - External attackers cannot compromise the routing process inside an ISD

- question: What is a drawback of the current Internet architecture?
  answer: |
    Paths are completely determined in the network, source can only set the destination.
    No control of transparency about network paths is possible.

- question: What is a drawback of source routing?
  answer: |
    End hosts learn complete network topology and calculate paths.
    Large overhead for end hosts, no control for network providers.

- question: What are benefits of SCION regarding path selection?
  answer: |
    ASes discover multiple paths that are consistent with their policies.
    Source host obtains multiple candidate paths and selects one.
    Path transparency and control for both network operators and end hosts.

- question: What is the job of the _control_ plane in SCION?
  answer: Routing - constructs and disseminates path segments.

- question: What is the job of the _data_ plane in SCION?
  answer: |
    Packet forwarding.
    Hosts combine path segments, data packets contain path.
    Routers authenticate information and forward packets based on path.
    Simple and stateless routers, no need for forwarding tables.

- question: How does SCION fundamentally resolve routing hijacks?
  answer: |
    - All routing messages are signed
    - End hosts select path and embed it in the packet header, path cannot be changed by attackers
    - End hosts can select paths that only traverse trusted ASes
    - Enables _geo-fencing_ for sensitive data

- question: Briefly compare SCION to BGP
  answer: |
    - Security, scalabilty
    - Multi-path: SCION can use multiple network paths simulatenously

- question: What does RINA stand for?
  answer: Recursive Internet Architecture

- question: What is RINA?
  answer: New network architecture that is based on the fundamental principle that networking is inter-process communication (IPC).

- question: What is provided by all layers in RINA?
  answer: Flows to two or more application instances with certain properties (delay, loss, etc).

- question: What are the three types of systems in RINA?
  answer: |
    - Host
    - Interior routers
    - Border routers

- question: What is the main benefit of RINA?
  answer: |
    Scales better, avoids problems with routing tables that the curent Internet infrastructure has.
    Its a flexible service model that can be adapted to the specific situation.
