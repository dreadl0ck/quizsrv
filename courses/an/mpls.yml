- question: What does MPLS stand for?
  answer: Multi-Protocol Label Switching

- question: What is MPLS used for?
  answer: It is a different forwarding method, based on labels, not addresses.

- question: What is one of the core benefits that MPLS has to offer?
  answer: Faster than address based routing, due to smaller numeric values and the lack of prefix matching.

- question: Why was there a need for MPLS within provider backbone networks?
  answer: Due to the full mesh requirement of iBGP speakers, the routing tables where becoming too big for the hardware to handle.

- question: What can be said about LSPs with regard to direction?
  answer: Label switched paths are always unidirectional.

- question: What does LSP stand for?
  answer: Label switched path

- question: How is an MPLS label composed on the wire?
  answer: |
    - 20 bits for label (a number)
    - 3 bits for EXP
    - 1 bit for Bottom of stack
    - 8 bits for TTL

- question: What does EXP stand for and what is its purpose in the MPLS header?
  answer: |
    Experimental Bits for Class of Service
    Orignally meant for QoS, not really used nowadays.

- question: Which label values are reserved by the MPLS protocol?
  answer: 0-15

- question: Is it possible to add multiple MPLS labels to a packet?
  answer: |
    Yes it is, the S bit is used to implement this.
    It is set to 1 to indicate the current label is the bottom of the stack.

- question: Where is the MPLS header placed on the wire?
  answer: Between the ethernet (L2) and the ip (L3) header.

- question:  What is stored in the table mpls.0?
  answer: It contains the MPLS labels.

  answer: |
    Label Information Base.
    A table that contains the labels and related addressing information.

- question: In which year did label switching start?
  answer: |
    - 1996 IP Switching, limited to ATM (Ipsilon)

  answer: |
    Asynchronous Transfer Mode.
    Packet switching technique similar to ISDN but providing higher speeds.

- question: What problems did occurs in the late 90s with regard to packet switching?
  answer: New equipment was overwhelmed by the growing amount of network traffic within a few months, and needed to be replaced with new hardware.

- question: Is MPLS applicable to any network layer protcol?
  answer: Yes it is! _Multi_ Protocol Layer Switching

- question: What does shim layer refer to?
  answer: |
    A 'fake' layer that has been inserted temporarely into the network packet.
    The MPLS header is commonly refered to as a shim header.

- question: What is the difference between routing and switching?
  answer: |
    - Switching: based on physical layer2 address, occurs within the subnet or the network.
    - Routing: based on network layer3 address, occurs between networks.

- question: Are mac addresses hierarchical?
  answer: No, they are handed out in blocks to vendors and are randomly assigned to network interface cards.

- question: What does FEC stand for?
  answer: |
    Forwarding Equivalence Class.
    A set of packets that receive the same treatment, in regard to queuing, next hop, egress interface etc.

- question: How is a FEC structured?
  answer: FEC is a route (address, prefix, set of prefixes)

- question: Are all packets with the same FEC forwarded with the same label?
  answer: Yes, all of them over the same LSP.

- question: What is a core difference between traditional routing and MPLS based routing?
  answer: |
    In traditional routing the FEC is determined at every hop.
    For MPLS, the FEC is determined only once at the ingress LER.

- question: With special type of addresses is used by Juniper routers for the FEC?
  answer: Loopback address of PE1 (= egress router).

- question: How are prefixes distributed within a MPLS enabled network?
  answer: Via OSPF or IS-IS as usual.

- question: Do MPLS have global significance, e.g. do they have to be globally unique?
  answer: No! MPLS labels are only locally significant to the processing router, the same label could be used by multiple routers.

- question: What happens during a label _push_ operation?
  answer: Packet enters on an LER and gets a MPLS label while being handed to the next hop.

- question: What happens during a label _pop_ operation?
  answer: Packet enters the destination LER and the MPLS label is removed again.

- question: What does PHP stand for?
  answer: |
    Penultimate Hop Poppping.
    Uses a special label 3 (Implicit Null Label), that signals the last router that the label pop and lookup can be skipped, and the packet shall be treated like a normal IP packet.
    Its a performance optimization that is not mandantory but enabled by default in modern implementations.

- question: Which label allocation scheme is used by MPLS?
  answer: |
    The MPLS architecture uses downstream label allocation.
    Downstream because the traffic flows in the opposite direction.
    Routers expect to receive traffic with the label they choose themselves.

- question: Whats the directional relation between the traffic and the label flow?
  answer: They move into opposite directions.

- question: Should a label be unique within a MPLS domain?
  answer: No, unique has to be unique on the router or per interface.

- question: What is the core purpose of MPLS?
  answer: Setting up virtual circuits / tunnels accross switched infrastructure.

- question: Why is the loopback interface commonly used to assign the router identifier?
  answer: A router can have many physical interfaces, but the loopback software interface is stable and always up.

  answer: |
    Either in a static or in a dynamic configuration.
    - Static: manual configuration in the routers of label bindings and LSPs.

- question: What is stored in the LDP Input label database?
  answer: MPLS labels that R1 must add to a packet when sending to a neighbor, used for learning routes.

- question: What is stored in the LDP Output label database?
  answer: MPLS labels that R2 expects to receive from neighbors, used to advertise routes.

- question: What is the command to show the LDP database on a Juniper router?
  answer: _show ldp database_

  answer: Towards the destination.

- question: What does RSVP stand for?
  answer: |
    Resource ReserVation Protocol.
    Bandwidth reservation protocol for individual traffic flows.

- question: What was the reason the RSVP protocol was not widely used?
  answer: Scales badly, due to requirement for setting up paths for individual traffic flows, and thus maintaining state for every flow.

  answer: No, RSVP was created before MPLS.

- question: What does the RSVP-TE extension do?
  answer: |
    The TE stands for Traffic Engineering.
    Improved version of RSVP that scales better, due to configuration per FEC (ingress and egress router pair).

- question: What does "Traffic Engineering" refer to?
  answer: The possibility to send traffic from source to destination on a path that differs from the lowest-cost path calculated by routing protocols.

- question: What is considered difficult with traditional IP routing protocols?
  answer: |
    - tweaking link cost or weight to influence IGP behavior
    - availability of resources (eg: bandwidth) not taken into account

- question: Name two other protocols that got traffic engineering extensions
  answer: IS-IS-TE and OSPF-TE.

- question: Is RSVP a signaling protocol or a routing protocol?
  answer: It is a signaling protocol.
