    - No more cicruit switching

- question: What does EPS stand for?
  answer: Evolved Packet System

- question: Where was EPS used?
  answer: The Evolved Packet System was the system architecture in LTE-Advanced.

- question: What are the components of the _Evolved Packet Core_?
  answer: |
    - Mobility Management Entity (MME): user context, authentication and authorization
    - Serving Gateway (SGW): transfers packets between edge and core
    - Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW): connects to external networks

- question: What is a benefit of the _Evolved Packet Core_?
  answer: Easier to scale for network operators.

- question: What does HSS stand for?
  answer: Home Subscriber Server

- question: What is stored in the _Home Subscriber Server_?
  answer: Database of user-related and subscriber-related information.

- question: What are the main functions of the E-UTRAN?
  answer: |
    - Radio resource management
    - Radio mobility control
    - Scheduling and dynamic allocation of radio resources
    - Security
    - Connectivity to EPC

- question: What is used by LTE for QoS instead of circuits?
  answer: EPS bearers are used instead.

- question: Which two classes of bearers do exist in LTE?
  answer: |
    - Non-GBR bearers: not guaranteed a minimum bit rate, useful for email and file transfer
    - Guaranteed Bit Rate bearers: useful for voice, interactive video, gaming

- question: On what information are handovers for mobility management based upon?
  answer: |
    - Radio link quality, user equipment capability, call type, QoS requirements, policy aspects
    - The Reference Signal Received Power (indicates radio link quality for a connection in an LTE cell)

- question: What does ICIC stand for?
  answer: Inter-cell interference coordination

- question: What is the purpose of ICIC?
  answer: Reduces interference when the same frequency is used in a neighboring cell.

- question: What types of channels do exist in LTE?
  answer: |
    - Logical channels
    - Transport channels
    - Physical channels

- question: What is the purpose of channels in LTE?
  answer: Provide services to the layers above.

- question: How is a network of large and small cells called?
  answer: A heterogeneous network (HetNet)

- question: What does CoMP stand for?
  answer: Coordinated Multipoint Transmission and Reception

- question: Briefly describe the core idea of CoMP
  answer: Reception alternates between multiple points, instead of using joint transmission.
