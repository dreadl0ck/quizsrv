- question: Explain _exposed_ terminals in wireless signaling
  answer: |
    - B sends to A, C wants to send to another terminal (not A or B)
    - C has to wait, CS signals a medium in use
    - but A is outside the radio range of C, therefore waiting it not neccessary
    - C is _exposed_ to B

- question: Explain _hidden_ terminals in wireless signaling
  answer: |
    - A sends to B, C cannot receive A
    - C wants to send to B, C senses a free medium (CS fails)
    - collision at B, A cannot receive the collision (CD fails)
    - A is _hidden_ for C
