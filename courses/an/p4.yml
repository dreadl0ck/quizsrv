  answer: Rules.

- question: What information does a table entry contain?
  answer: |
    - Key to match on
    - A _single_ action that is executed upon match
    - Action data (possibly empty)

- question: Based on what information are the table entries populated from the control plane?
  answer: |
    - Based on the configuration
    - Based on automatic discovery
    - Based on protocol
