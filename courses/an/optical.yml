- question: What is the wavelength of the _infrared_ spectrum?
  answer: 850nm - 1625nm

- question: What is the wavelength of the visible light spectrum?
  answer: 400nm - 700nm

- question: What types of antennas do exist?
  answer: |
    - Directional antennas
    - Omnidirectional antennas

- question: What is a _tuner_?
  answer: A resonator tuned on a particular frequency or frequency band.

- question: Which factors affect wave propagation and impairment?
  answer: |
    - Reflection
    - Diffraction
    - Absorption
    - Polarization
    - Refraction

- question: What is _diffraction_?
  answer: Radio signal encounters and obstacle that is larger than its size in wavelength, signal propagates to a different source.

- question: What is the effect of _attenuation_?
  answer: Reduces power level with distance.

- question: What is _refraction_?
  answer: The change in direction of a wave passing from one medium to another.

- question: What is _noise_ in signal processing?
  answer: Unwanted signal, either man made or naturally occuring.

- question: What is _interference_?
  answer: Signals generated by communications devices operating at roughly the same frquencies may interfere with one another.

- question: What does SINR stand for?
  answer: Signal to interference and noise ratio

- question: What is SINR being used for?
  answer: Signal to interference and noise ratio is a metric used assessment of channel quality.

- question: What is _fading_?
  answer: |
    Strength of the signal decreases with distance between transmitter and receiver: path loss.

- question: What causes _slow fading_?
  answer: Caused by large obstructions between transmitter and receiver.

- question: What causes _fast fading_?
  answer: Caused by scatterers in the vicinity of the transmitter.
