- question: What is controlled by a network slice?
  answer: A subset of traffic towards a network.

- question: How is the subset controlled by a network slice defined?
  answer: By a collection of packet headers (flowspace).

- question: What is defined by a subset of flowspace in combination with a subset of topology?
  answer: A network slice.

- question: What are the goals of FlowVisor?
  answer: |
    - Transparency
    - Isolation between slices
    - Extensible slice definition

- question: What are slicing policies?
  answer: Specifies resource limits for each slice.

- question: What are the resource limits specified by slicing policies?
  answer: |
    - Link bandwidth
    - Maximum number of forwarding rules
    - Topology
    - Fraction of switch/router CPU
    - FlowSpace: which packets are controlled by the slice?

- question: Can FlowVisors be nested?
  answer: Yes.

- question: Name three Hypervisors that build on FlowVisor
  answer: |
    - AdVisor
    - VeRTIGO
    - Enhanced Flow Visor

- question: Name three distributed Hypervisors
  answer: |
    - OpenVirtex
    - Network Hypervisor
    - FlowN

- question: What is Network Function Virtualization used for?
  answer: Moving networking functionalities outside the network nodes.

- question: What are benefits of FlowVisor?
  answer: |
    - Programmability
    - Strong isolation model

- question: What is a mojor drawback of FlowVisor?
  answer: Protocol support is defined in the standard, which makes it inflexible and usuable to handle non IP traffic.

- question: What is purpose of FlowVisor?
  answer: |
    - Divide the production network into logical slices
    - Delegate control of each slice to a different controller
    - Enforce strong isolation
    - Allows logical testbed to mirror production network

- question: How does FlowVisor operate?
  answer: Acts as a proxy, intercepts messages between OpenFlow controller and OpenFlow enabled switch, rewrites messages according to policy.
