- question: What is a common commercial tool for wireless penetration testing?
  answer: The WiFi Pineapple

- question: What are common attacks against WPA networks?
  answer: |
    - Evil Portal
    - MitM
    - Handshake sniffing
    - Deauth attacks

- question: How many packets are needed to complete a full WPA handshake?
  answer: 4

- question: How does the Karma attack work?
  answer: |
    Devices send Prefered Network List, then these networks are replicated by the attacker.

- question: What mechanism does Android offer to defend against the Karma attack?
  answer: |
    Turn on WiFi automatically in known locations.
    Prevents device from broadcasting prefered network list everywhere.

- question: What is the PMKID attack?
  answer: |
    Some routers append the PMKID in the SNR field of the EAPOL frames.
    This allows to crack encryption key even for networks without clients connected.

- question: How can the deauth frame be used to gather full handshake from connected clients?
  answer: By deauthing them, the client will reconnect automatically and the handshake can be captured via sniffing.

- question: What is a core security improvement of WPA3?
  answer: WPA3 will be much harder to attack because of its modern key establishment protocol called "Simultaneous Authentication of Equals" (SAE).

- question: How are management frames protected in WPA3?
  answer: TODO

- question: Are management frames protected in WPA/WPA2?
  answer: Not by default, only in WPA2 Enterprise.

- question: Which features must be supported by a network card to be usable for WiFi attacks?
  answer: Packet injection and monitor mode.

- question: What is a great open source tool to conduct wireless attacks and reconaissance?
  answer: bettercap (https://bettercap.org)

- question: What is the purpose of IEEE 802.11c?
  answer: Bridging between AP's

- question: What does ISM stand for and what purpose does it have?
  answer: |
    Industrial Scientific Medical
    The ISM radio bands are portions of the radio spectrum reserved internationally for industrial, scientific and medical purposes, excluding applications in telecommunications

- question: Which channels from the 2.4GHz band should be preferred because they do not overlap?
  answer: Channels 1, 6 and 11

- question: How many non overlapping channels are in the 5GHz band?
  answer: 24

- question: What is the channel width for the 5GHz band?
  answer: 20MHz

- question: Explain what happens during _active_ scanning
  answer: The client initiates the effort by sending a probe.

- question: Explain what happens during _passive_ scanning
  answer: The client just listens, AP broadcasts a beacon frame.

- question: Briefly describe what happens during joining an Access Point (AP)
  answer: |
    1. Scan for access points
    2. Authenticate to the access point
    3. Associate to the access point
      - AP will keep track of client MAC address

- question: Whats the name of the standard that first introduced encryption to the WiFi?
  answer: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)

- question: What are problems with WEP?
  answer: |
    - based on RC4 cipher
    - Shared key (fixed)
    - IV has to be unique for each packet
      - only 16 bits of 24 bit IV actually used
      - predictable
      - CRC32 is weak and easy to forge

- question: How can WEP be attacked in practice?
  answer: |
    1. Send ping, we know the plaintext response
    2. Get encrypted response
    3. Calculate RC4 stream
    4. Store RC4 stream indexed for each IV
    5. Now every packet can be decrypted

- question: How is authentication implemented in WEP?
  answer: |
    MAC address based, two options:
    1. Open: any client can associate
    2. Closed: only known clients can associate

- question: What does TKIP stand for?
  answer: Temporal key integrity protocol

- question: What does RSN stand for?
  answer: Robust Security Network

- question: How was TKIP used to overcome WEP weaknesses without the need for new hardware?
  answer: |
    802.11i:
    - Message integrity code
    - New IV sequencing
    - Per packet mixing function
    - Re-Keying
