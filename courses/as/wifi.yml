- question: What is a common commercial tool for wireless penetration testing?
  answer: The WiFi Pineapple

- question: What are common attacks against WPA networks?
  answer: |
    - Evil Portal
    - MitM
    - Handshake sniffing
    - Deauth attacks

- question: How many packets are needed to complete a full WPA handshake?
  answer: 4

- question: How does the Karma attack work?
  answer: |
    Devices send Prefered Network List, then these networks are replicated by the attacker.

- question: What mechanism does Android offer to defend against the Karma attack?
  answer: |
    Turn on WiFi automatically in known locations.
    Prevents device from broadcasting prefered network list everywhere.

- question: What is the PMKID attack?
  answer: |
    Some routers append the PMKID in the SNR field of the EAPOL frames.
    This allows to crack encryption key even for networks without clients connected.

- question: How can the deauth frame be used to gather full handshake from connected clients?
  answer: By deauthing them, the client will reconnect automatically and the handshake can be captured via sniffing.

- question: What is a core security improvement of WPA3?
  answer: WPA3 will be much harder to attack because of its modern key establishment protocol called "Simultaneous Authentication of Equals" (SAE).

- question: How are management frames protected in WPA3?
  answer: TODO

- question: Are management frames protected in WPA/WPA2?
  answer: Not by default, only in WPA2 Enterprise.

- question: Which features must be supported by a network card to be usable for WiFi attacks?
  answer: Packet injection and monitor mode.
