- question: What does the term fuzzing refer to?
  answer: |
    Fuzz testing is an automated software testing method where invalid, or malformed inputs are applied to a target application, in order to provoke a crash.
    Spotting bugs early in the development cycle helps to improve stability and security.

- question: What testing methods do exist for fuzzing?
  answer: |
    - White box testing: source code of target is available
    - Black box testing: no source code available
    - Gray box testing: source code partially available

- question: What phases are executed during fuzzing?
  answer: |
    1. Target identification
    2. Input identification
    3. Generate input data
    4. Feed data
    5. Monitor for memory corruptions or crashes
    6. Determine exploitability

- question: Explain _generational_ input data generation
  answer: |
    - Data is created from scratch based on grammar rules such as ABNF
    - Drawback: slower generation of input

- question: Explain _mutational_ input data generation
  answer: |
    - Data is created based on input files (corpus) and mutating them
    - Drawback: coverage might be incomplete, due to choice of corpus
