- question: What is a better error correction method than BCH?
  answer: LDPC (Low Density Parity Check)

- question: Which error correction method is becoming more popular and why?
  answer: |
    LDPC (Low Density Parity Check)
    More efficient, because less space needed for error correction code.

- question: Who decides how much space is used for error correction and based on what criteria?
  answer: Decided by the controller vendor, based on their requirements for the amount of errors that shall be correctable.

- question: What is the layout on an 8K flash memory page, when having 2048 bytes of data and using ECC?
  answer: |
    Data (2048 bytes) | ECC (90 bytes) | ...

- question: What do the values X and Y mean in BCH(X,Y)?
  answer: |
    X = Total data size
    Y = Size of data payload without error correction code

- question: What happens if the ECC code section has errors as well?
  answer: The ECC code is covering the entire message and can thus also be used to correct itself, so errors can be tolerated to a certain level.

- question: What has to be identified in order to decode data that is protected with BCH?
  answer: The polynomial, among other parameters like page size etc.

- question: Where can parameter configurations for different flash memory vendors be looked up?
  answer: For example at flash-extractor.com

- question: What is a good software to analyze flash memory dumps?
  answer: |
    ruSolut Visual Nand Reconstructor
    and
    ACELab PC-3000

- question: What is a good flash memory reader hardware device?
  answer: |
    ruSolut Visual Nand Reconstructor comes with an FPGA based NAND reader device.
    Alternatively, ACELab also has a reader device the PC-3000 spider board.

- question: What happens during scrambling of flash memory?
  answer: |
    Original data gets XORed with pseudo random bytes produced by the flash controller.
    Unlike true encryption, scrambling patterns are not designed for security reasons and are therefore easy to identify, extract and then use for data recovery.

- question: How does data look like after scrambling?
  answer: A repeating pattern is visible.

- question: What is the reason that data can often be recovered from flash devices?
  answer: Error correction codes, shadow copies made by the flash controller, or damaged pages that still contain old information and have been abandoned.

- question: What is the name of the strategy a scrambler applies to obfuscate the data?
  answer: One Time Pad (XOR input data with random bytes)

- question: Explain what wear leveling is and why it's needed
  answer: |
    Wear leveling is a technique for prolonging the service life of some kinds of erasable computer storage media, such as flash memory.
    It is needed because frequent access to the same memory cells would degrade them quickly and lead to a short life time of the hardware.

- question: Can the page data of flash memory be erased?
  answer: |
    Deleting data has to happen at the block level, one block contains multiple pages.
    If any page is detected to be corrupted, usually it does not get deleted, because the other pages in the block still contain valid data.

- question: What does LBN stand for?
  answer: Logical Block Number

- question: What does LPN stand for?
  answer: Logical Page Number

- question: What can be done if the error rate is too high and not correctable?
  answer: Rereading the device can help, or changing the voltage used during dumping the data.

- question: Which steps have to be taken in order to recover data from flash based devices?
  answer: |
    - Extract raw flash data
    - Identify ECC protocol and parameters
    - Identify scrambling protocol and parameters
    - Identify wear-leveling scheme (LBN,LPN)
    - Reconstruct the physical image
    - Look for data remnants in unused area on flash
