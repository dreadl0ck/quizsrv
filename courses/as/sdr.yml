- question: How can you calculate the receiver signal strength?
  answer: Receiver signal = Sender signal - Loss + Noise

- question: Which frequency is used for the FM band?
  answer: 95 MHz

- question: What does GNSS stand for?
  answer: Global Navigation Systems

- question: What does a debiasing algorithm do?
  answer: |
    Debiasing is the reduction of bias, particularly with respect to judgment and decision making.
    A debiasing algorithm extracts only the random bits from a stream of bytes, and discards consecutive sequences of identical values.

- question: What is a possible attack vector against VN debiasing?
  answer: Denial of Service

- question: What is the oldest debiasing algorithm?
  answer: Von Neumann Debiasing

- question: Which debiasing algorithm offers additional security?
  answer: Kaminsky Debiasing

- question: What is expressed by the _entropy_ of data?
  answer: |
    Entropy is a measure for randomness.
    Higher entropy means higher randomness, likely due to encryption or compression for example.

- question: Which frequency is used by the ISS to transfer Voice and SSTV downlink?
  answer: 145.8 MHz

- question: What test suite can be used to check data with regard to randomness?
  answer: NIST STS

- question: Can RF signals like white noise be used to gather truly random bytes for cryptographic operations?
  answer: |
    Yes, cosmic noise is truly random.
    But beware of external interference and consider to encase the antenna in a faraday cage, to capture only thermal noise from the device itself.
    The choice of debiasing strategy is also important.

- question: How can truly random data be gathered in a way that is less prone to external interference?
  answer: By using a hardware randomness generator like the ChaosKey.

- question: Describe the benefits of SDR
  answer: |
    Software Defined Radio allows to implement components like filters or modulators in software, instead of using dedicated hardware.
    This makes implemetation and research of new technologies much cheaper and faster.

- question: What does SDR stand for?
  answer: Software Defined Radio
