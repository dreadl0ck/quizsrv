- question: What is a common tool to sniff bluetooth traffic and which known limitation does it have?
  answer: |
    The Ubertooth One.
    Can only sniff on a single advertisement channel at the same time,
    which can lead to missing the pairing process.

- question: How many advertisement channels are there in the bluetooth standard?
  answer: 3

- question: On which radio frequency is Bluetooth located?
  answer: 2.4GHz

- question: What is the unit used to express the _signal strength_?
  answer: |
    dBm: unit of level used to indicate that a power level is expressed in decibels with reference to one milliwatt.

- question: What is the unit used to express the _channel frequency_?
  answer: Hertz (Hz)

- question: What does SNR stand for?
  answer: Signal to Noise Ratio

- question: What is the LAP used for in Bluetooth and how many bytes is it?
  answer: |
    Lower Address Part (3 bytes).
    This portion of Bluetooth Address is allocated by the vendor of device.
    The LAP value uniquely identifies a Bluetooth device as part of the Access Code in every transmitted frame.

- question: What is the UAP used for in Bluetooth and how many bytes is it?
  answer: |
    Upper Address Part (1 byte).
    Contains remaining 8 bits of the OUI.
    The UAP value is used for seeding in various Bluetooth specification algorithms.

- question: What does LAP stand for?
  answer: Lower Address Part

- question: What does UAP stand for?
  answer: Upper Address Part

  answer: LE Secure Connection is introduced in Bluetooth version 4.2 (2014)

- question: Which versions of BTLE are vulnerable to MitM attacks?
  answer: BTLE v4.0 and v4.1

- question: What can be used to reduce signal interference?
  answer: A faraday cage.

- question: Which PDU type is used to enable encryption in BTLE 4.1?
  answer: LL_FEATURE_REQ

- question: Which PDU type is used to enable encryption in BTLE 4.2?
  answer: LL_ENC_REQ

- question: Name three key attributes of BTLE
  answer: Lost cost, low energy, low distance

- question: What is the IEEE standard indentifier for bluetooth?
  answer: IEEE 802.15

- question: What does GATT stand for?
  answer: Generic Attribute Profile

- question: What does GAP stand for?
  answer: Generic Access Profile

- question: Where does the name bluetooth originate from?
  answer: Named after the analogy that bluetooth would unite devices the way Harald Bluetooth united the tribes of Denmark into a single kingdom.

- question: What does HCI stand for?
  answer: Host Controller Interface

- question: What is the purpose of the HCI?
  answer: Host Controller Interface serves as an interface between RF radio hardware and the software drivers.

- question: Who developed frequency hopping and why?
  answer: Hedy Lamarr, she created a radio guidance system during WW2 for allied torpedoes that was more diffult to jam.

  answer: 34 different profiles.

- question: Name five common bluetooth profiles
  answer: |
    - HID (Human Interface Device)
    - DUN (Dialup Networking)
    - FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
    - HFP (Handsfree Protocol)
    - OBEX (Object Exchange Protocol)

- question: What is the definition of a bluetooth profile and what is required for two devices to communicate?
  answer: |
    Bluetooth profiles are a a set of services or functions that a device will offer.
    In order to communicate, two devices must implement a common subset of these functions.
