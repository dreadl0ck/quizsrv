- question: What is the purpose and the design of the Secure Enclave?
  answer: |
    - Crypto coprocessor in A7+, for key management and crypto operations
    - Device-specific inaccessible UID key
    - Hardwired GID key
    - Hardware RNG
    - Stores fingerprint + face digest
    - Secure ECC computing, L4 microkernel

- question: What is the purpose and design of the Memory Protection Engine?
  answer: |
    - Protects memory used by the SEnc from the CPU
    - Encrypts and protects integrity
    - Protects against replay attack and bus sniffing
    - AES in Mac XEX mode ('xor-encrypt-xor')

- question: What's the purpose of the AES engine?
  answer: |
    - Encrypts and decrypts from flash to memory and vice versa

- question: Why is transplantation of flash memory impossible for iOS devices?
  answer: Because the keys used in by the AES engine are linked to the Secure Enclave and device UID.

- question: How does TouchID work in a nutshell?
  answer: |
    - Finger scan sent to SEnc (encrypted)
    - Converted into lossy vector representation
    - Stored or compared against stored data
    - Only accessible to SEnc, no backups

- question: How does FaceID work in a nutshell?
  answer: |
    - 30K random points on face + 2D infrared images
    - sent to SEnc (encrypted), only accessible to SEnc

- question: How does the Secure Neural Engine work in a nutshell?
  answer: |
    - Converts 2D and depth maps into mathematical representations
    - Previously part of SEnc
    - Uses memory protection engine for securing allocated memory

- question: What is the Secure Element?
  answer: |
    - Java card platform, used for Apple Pay
    - Compliant with financial industry requirement for electronic payments
