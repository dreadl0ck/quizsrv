- question: In which radix are IPv6 addresses written? And what about the slide number
    references in all the answers of this anki deck?
  answer: Base16 or Hexadecimal.
- question: What replaces gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr() in IPv6?
  answer: |-
    getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo()

- question: What record will `dig -x 1337:a::f` ask for?
  answer: |-
    f.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.a.0.0.0.7.3.3.1.ip6.arpa.
- question: How does 6to4 work? Was it made for an IPv6-only internet or an IPv4-only
    internet?
  answer: |
    Everyone with a public v4 address gets an IPv6 site: 2002:a.b.c.d::/48
    A 6to4 router acts as gateway between 6to4 space to native IPv6 space.
    It's made for an IPv4-only internet, to connect v6-only islands.
- question: How can one represent an IPv4-only host in an IPv6-only network?
  answer: |-
    IPv4-converted addresses.
- question: What are some transition technologies for IPv4 to IPv6?
  answer: |-
    6rd (IPv6 Rapid Deployment)
    NAT64 and DNS64
    DS-Lite (ISP network is IPv6-only, uses v4-in-v6 tunnels and CGNAT)
    6to4
    ISATAP and Teredo
- question: What fields does the IPv6 header have, how long are they and what is their
    purpose?
  answer: |-
    Version (4 bits) always 0110 (=6);
    Traffic Class (8 bits) 6 bits for Differentiated Services and 2 bits for Explicit Congestion Notification;
    Flowlabel (20 bits) identifies flows with special requirements;
    Payload Length (16 bits) including extension headers;
    Next Header (8 bits) type of following header;
    Hop Limit (8 bits) forwarding count and loop protection;
    Source address (128 bits); and
    Destination Address (128 bits).
- question: What ICMPv6 types are used for NDP?
  answer: |
    - 133: Router Solicitation
    - 134: Router Advertisement
    - 135: Neighbor Solicitation
    - 136: Neighbor Advertisement
    - 137: Redirect Message
- question: What is NDP?
  answer: |-
    Neighbor Discovery Protocol, used for duplicate address detection / neighbour unreachability detection / discovering network properties / find addresses of neighbours.
    It makes extensive use of multicast.

- question: What is the traditional unicast allocation hierarchy?
  answer: |-
    16-16-16-16-64:
    - /16 RIR space (from IANA)
    - /32 ISP allocations (from RIR)
    - /48 customer allocations (from ISP)
    - /64 customer network (an IPv6 subnet)

- question: What is a sollicited node address?
  answer: |-
    A multicast address which includes 24 bits of the unicast/anycast address on the interface under consideration.
    It has the form ff02::1:ffxx:xxxx and is link-local.
    It is used in Neighbor Solicitation.

- question: Why does 'ping6 fe80::1' typically not work, assuming there is a node
    with that address?
  answer: |-
    You need to specify an interface.
    In the example of ping6, you can do this using -I (capital i) and many other tools will have similar options, or you need to add %interface to the address
    e.g. fe80::1%eth0

- question: What are the multicast addresses for all nodes, routers (link-local) and
    routers (site-local)?
  answer: |-
    ff02::1, ff02::2 and ff05::2

- question: What scopes are available in a multicast address?
  answer: |-
    0 (0000) and f (1111) are reserved.2=link-local5=site-locale=global
- question: What flags are used in a multicast address?
  answer: |-
    The flags are the third nibble (the first zero in ff00::/8).
    They are 0RPT where:
    - T=transient (0=permanent)
    - P=prefix-owned
    - R=RP-embedded
    (what the flags mean is not part of the 2018 exam)
- question: Why is it ff00::/8 instead of ff::/8? What do the 00s mean?
  answer: |-
    Short form dictates that leading zeros are skipped.
    Thus ff::/8 is equal to 00ff::/8 and not ff00::/8.
    The remaining byte (the zeroes) are used for flags (4 bits) and scope (4 bits).
- question: What is Unique Local Unicast?
  answer: |-
    The range fc00::/7 is supposed to be subnetted like fdrr:rrrr:rrrr:ssss::/64 where the "r"s are random bits and ssss is a subnet id.
    It's fd instead of fc because the "local bit" is set to 1.
    It's designed so companies using such local space can be merged with a very small chance of collisions.
- question: What is an anycast address?
  answer: |-
    A single address announced from multiple locations.
    It will reach only one endpoint.
    It looks like a normal unicast address (it's allocated from unicast space).
- question: What IPv6 allocation is made for documentation purposes?
  answer: |-
    2001:db8::/32
- question: What are some of the first global unicast address allocations?
  answer: |
    2001::/16 is the first RIR space
    2002::/16 is 6to4 space
    3ffe::/16 was for 6bone (returned to IANA)
    (sub prefix of fully reserved 4000::/2)5f00::/8 6bone (returned to IANA)
    (sub prefix of fully reserved 4000::/2)
- question: What is algorithmic translation?
  answer: |-
    Stateless.
    Since it's algorithmic, i.e.
    an algorithm can translate it without needing to look anything up (it just does some computation), it doesn't need state.
- question: What does modern algorithmic translation to IPv4 use?
  answer: |-
    64:ff9b::/96 (well known prefix)
- question: What are some addresses in special-purpose space?
  answer: |-
    ::/128 is "unspecified address", like 0.0.0.0 in IPv4.
    ::1/128 is localhost
    ::a.b.c.d/128 is an IPv4-compatible address (used for automatic tunneling, now deprecated)
    ::ffff:a.b.c.d/128 (from ::ffff:0:0/96) is an IPv4-mapped address (never seen on the wire, only for IPv6-only applications to communicate with v4-only hosts)
    64:ff9b::/96 is a well-known prefix (used by algorithmic translation)
    100::/64 is the discard-only address block
- question: What is ff00::/8 and 100::/8?
  answer: |-
    ff00::/8 is multicast and 100::/8 is special-purpose.
- question: Name some top level allocations
  answer: |
    ::/8 special-purpose
    100::/8 special-purpose
    2000::/3 global unicast
    fc00::/7 unique local unicast
    fe80::/10 link-local (link-scoped) unicast
    ff00::/8 multicast
- question: What happened to broadcast in IPv6?
  answer: |-
    This was replaced by multicast.
    (unfortunately ISPs do not know how to route this so most traffic is blocked)
- question: |
    What is the short form of
    0000:0000:0130:1000:0001:0000:0000:0001/64?
  answer: |-
    0:0:130:1000:1::1/64
    You can choose yourself where you place the double colon, but there cannot be two double colons.
    It could also have been ::130:1000:1:0:0:1/64.
- question: Can mixed notation of IPv4 also be used in IPv6
  answer: duh
- question: What is mixed notation in IPv4?
  answer: |-
    A host and network in one notation.
    You'll probably wonder "huh, that's just normal notation right?" and the answer is yes.
    Something like 131.211.140.25/26 where the network is 131.211.140.0/26.
- question: What might move people to use IPv6?
  answer: |-
    QoS (flowlabel is present in the standard header) and hierarchical routing (nothing new, but we have space to expand again)
- question: What is the advantage of "no NAT needed"?
  answer: |-
    The end-to-end principle could be reinstated.
- question: What protocol is used in stateful autoconfiguration for IPv6?
  answer: |-
    DHCPv6
- question: What does "built-in security" mean?
  answer: |-
    Anyone implementing IPv6 is required by the spec to implement IPSEC.
    Therefore anyone speaking IPv6 can also speak IPSEC.
- question: Why should IPv6 be used?
  answer: |
    - Many more addresses (how many more?)
    - Only 4 times as many bits (4 x 32 = 128)
    - Autoconfiguration (stateless or stateful)
    - Built-in IPsec for security
    - No NAT needed
    - Mobility (direct end-to-end communication)
    - Optimized headers (fixed length (40 bytes) with extension header mechanism)
- question: How many more addresses are there in IPv6?
  answer: |
    (2^128) / (2^32) = 2^96
