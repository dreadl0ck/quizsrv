    It makes extensive use of multicast.

- question: What is the traditional unicast allocation hierarchy?
  answer: |-
    16-16-16-16-64:
    - /16 RIR space (from IANA)
    - /32 ISP allocations (from RIR)
    - /48 customer allocations (from ISP)
    - /64 customer network (an IPv6 subnet)

- question: What is a sollicited node address?
  answer: |-
    A multicast address which includes 24 bits of the unicast/anycast address on the interface under consideration.
    It has the form ff02::1:ffxx:xxxx and is link-local.
    It is used in Neighbor Solicitation.

- question: Why does 'ping6 fe80::1' typically not work, assuming there is a node with that address?
  answer: |-
    You need to specify an interface.
    In the example of ping6, you can do this using the -I flag
    Other tools will have similar options, sometimes you need to add %interface to the address e.g. fe80::1%eth0

- question: What is the multicast address for all nodes?
  answer: ff02::1

- question: What is the multicast address for routers (link-local)?
  answer: ff02::2

    0 (0000) and f (1111) are reserved.
    2 = link-local
    5 = site-locale=global

- question: What flags are used in a multicast address?
  answer: |-
    The flags are the third nibble (the first zero in ff00::/8).
    They are 0RPT where:
    - T=transient (0=permanent)
    - P=prefix-owned
    - R=RP-embedded
    (what the flags mean is not part of the 2018 exam)
- question: Why is it ff00::/8 instead of ff::/8? What do the 00s mean?
  answer: |-
    Short form dictates that leading zeros are skipped.
    Thus ff::/8 is equal to 00ff::/8 and not ff00::/8.
    The remaining byte (the zeroes) are used for flags (4 bits) and scope (4 bits).

- question: What is Unique Local Unicast?
  answer: |-
    The range fc00::/7 is supposed to be subnetted like fdrr:rrrr:rrrr:ssss::/64 where the "r"s are random bits and ssss is a subnet id.
    It's fd instead of fc because the "local bit" is set to 1.
    It's designed so companies using such local space can be merged with a very small chance of collisions.

- question: What is an anycast address?
  answer: |-
    A single address announced from multiple locations.
    It will reach only one endpoint.
    It looks like a normal unicast address (it's allocated from unicast space).

- question: What IPv6 allocation is made for documentation purposes?
  answer: |-
    2001:db8::/32

- question: What are some of the first global unicast address allocations?
  answer: |

    2002::/16 is 6to4 space
    3ffe::/16 was for 6bone (returned to IANA)
    (sub prefix of fully reserved 4000::/2)5f00::/8 6bone (returned to IANA)
    (sub prefix of fully reserved 4000::/2)

- question: What is algorithmic translation?
  answer: |-
    Stateless.
    Since it's algorithmic, i.e.
    an algorithm can translate it without needing to look anything up (it just does some computation), it doesn't need state.

- question: What does modern algorithmic translation to IPv4 use?
  answer: |-
    64:ff9b::/96 (well known prefix)

- question: Name 5 special purpose IPv6 addresses
  answer: |-
    ::/128 is "unspecified address", like 0.0.0.0 in IPv4.
    ::1/128 is localhost
    ::a.b.c.d/128 is an IPv4-compatible address (used for automatic tunneling, now deprecated)
    ::ffff:a.b.c.d/128 (from ::ffff:0:0/96) is an IPv4-mapped address (never seen on the wire, only for IPv6-only applications to communicate with v4-only hosts)
    64:ff9b::/96 is a well-known prefix (used by algorithmic translation)

- question: What is the discard-only address block?
  answer: 100::/64

- question: What is the purpose of the discard-only address block?
  answer: Used for sinkholing, useful for defending against DDoS attacks for example.

  answer: |-
    ff00::/8 is multicast and 100::/8 is special-purpose.

- question: Name some top level allocations
  answer: |
    ::/8 special-purpose
    100::/8 special-purpose
    2000::/3 global unicast
    fc00::/7 unique local unicast
    fe80::/10 link-local (link-scoped) unicast
    ff00::/8 multicast

- question: What happened to broadcast in IPv6?
  answer: |-
    This was replaced by multicast.
    (unfortunately ISPs do not know how to route this so most traffic is blocked)

- question: |
    What is the short form of
    0000:0000:0130:1000:0001:0000:0000:0001/64?
  answer: |-
    0:0:130:1000:1::1/64
    You can choose yourself where you place the double colon, but there cannot be two double colons.
    It could also have been ::130:1000:1:0:0:1/64.

- question: Can mixed notation of IPv4 also be used in IPv6
  answer: |
    ?

- question: What is mixed notation in IPv4?
  answer: |-
    A host and network in one notation.
    You'll probably wonder "huh, that's just normal notation right?" and the answer is yes.
    Something like 131.211.140.25/26 where the network is 131.211.140.0/26.

  answer: |-
    - QoS (flowlabel is present in the standard header)
    - Hierarchical routing (nothing new, but we have space to expand again)

- question: What is the advantage of "no NAT needed"?
  answer: The end-to-end principle could be reinstated.

- question: What protocol is used in stateful autoconfiguration for IPv6?
  answer: DHCPv6

- question: What does "built-in security" mean?
  answer: |-
    Anyone implementing IPv6 is required by the spec to implement IPSEC.
    Therefore anyone speaking IPv6 can also speak IPSEC.

- question: Why should IPv6 be used?
  answer: |
    - Many more addresses (how many more?)
    - Only 4 times as many bits (4 x 32 = 128)
    - Autoconfiguration (stateless or stateful)
    - Built-in IPsec for security
    - No NAT needed
    - Mobility (direct end-to-end communication)
    - Optimized headers (fixed length (40 bytes) with extension header mechanism)

- question: How long is an IPv6 header?

      - Client and server dual stack
      - Stateless IP / ICMP Translation (SIIT)
      - Bump in the Stack (BIS)

- question: Name three _current_ IETF transition techniques
  answer: |
    - Client and server dual stack
    - 6to4
    - ISATAP

- question: How do IPv6 only client reach IPv4 only servers?
  answer: |
    Basically one big NAT scheme.
    - RFC 6145: IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm, Header translation
    - RFC 6146: Stateful NAT64
    - RFC 6147: DNS64

- question: Which combination of transition techniques results in a possible security nightmare?
  answer: ISATAP + 6to4

- question: What does ISATAP stand for?
  answer: Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol

- question: How does ISATAP work?
  answer: |
    - PREFIX: 0:5efe:a.b.c.d
    - Uses IPv4 encapsulation inside the domain as data link layer
    - Default gateway should be a full blown IPv6 router

- question: Which domain name is used for reverse IPv6 lookups?
  answer: ip6.arpa

- question: Why are reverse lookups of IPv6 addresses considered 'clumsy'?
  answer: Because the resulting origin names are very long and annoying to read.

- question: How many IPv4 addresses are wasted due to being reserved?
  answer: |
    1/16 of the total.
    Good example for legacy software issues.

- question: How many octets in a class B directed broadcast equal 255?
  answer: |
    2 or 3
    in the network part there can be a 255
    first octet can't be 255 - would fall into reserved range or broadcast
    but second octet can be 255 and has been given out in some cases

- question: Why are broadcasts often not permitted?
  answer: Because they can be used for Denial of Service attacks against remote networks.

- question: What is the aggregated length of the 16 class B private networks?
  answer: |
    aggregated range is /12
    one class B network is /16
    all 16 class B networks: 4 bits needed for network part
    (2^4=16) -> /12

- question: Classical RFC 950 subnetting with a mask of 255.255.255.72 gives how many subnetworks?
  answer: |
    2 subnetworks 62 hosts
    2^2 - 2 for networks
    remaining bits for the host are 6: 2^6=64 hosts
    subtract 2 for not using 00 and 11 in RFC 950 = 62 hosts

  answer: supernetting

- question: How is splitting up networks into smaller systems called?
  answer: subnetting

- question: Is VLSM related to _subnetting_ or to _supernetting_?
  answer: |
    subnetting.
    VLSM = Variable Length _Subnet_ Masks

- question: Is CIDR related to _subnetting_ or to _supernetting_?
  answer: |
    mainly supernetting.
    CIDR moves border of network and hosts to an arbitrary position, used to aggregate multiple networks.
    But can also be used for subnetting.

- question: What is the second prefix with prefix length 17?
  answer: |
    0.0.128.0/17
    First 16 bit are zeroes, 17th bit is 1 followed by zeroes
    1000 0000 -> 128

- question: According to the original semantics of subnetting and data links, point to point links should use which prefix?
  answer: |
    /30 or smaller
    You want to allocate IP addresses to both sides -> needs at least two bits for host part
    If smaller, you would waste address space.

- question: What link types should be avoided according to the IAB?
  answer: |
    to be avoided: multi-link - produces all kinds of issues
    possible: multi-subnet - added to IPv4, more practical in IPv6
