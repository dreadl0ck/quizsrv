- question: Why is IBGP scaling needed? What methods are available to do it and how do they work?
  answer: |-
    IBGP scaling is needed because IBGP routers need to be configured in a full-mesh topology.
    You need N(N-1)/2 connections to connect them all.
    With a lot of routers, this is undoable.
    Route reflectors and confederations can help to scale IBGP.

- question: Which classical attribute is used to prevent your upstream to use hot
    potato routing? Is this always successful? What attribute was introduced later
    to communicate preferences to your upstream or ot receive extra routing information
    from your upstream?
  answer: |-
    Hot potato routing: go over cheaper path.
    You can set the MED to influence this, but this doesn always work because it involves the peer's cooperations.
    Communities are used to do finetuned control between peers.

- question: |-
    What is the name in OSPF for a router that is part of multiple areas? Name the different OSPF LSAs having type 1 to 5.
    Mention for each type the router that originates these LSAs.
  answer: |+
    ABR (Area Border Router)
    <img src="/files/anki/paste-25039659335681.jpg" />
    1 = originated by every router
    2 = originated by the DR
    3 = originated by the ABR
    4 = originated by the ABR
    5 = Originated by ASBR

    Draw the result of the Dijkstra algorithm in the following graph, starting from the source node "a".
    Label the nodes "b", "c", "d", in the order of addition to the shortes path tree and make the dotted lines solid for edges belonging to this shortes path tree.
    Note that each undirected edge may be used in both directions. Inidcate clearly, using arrows, the direction you use in your drawing.

    Draw the result of a run of the STP protocol in the network given below.
    The numbers given are the bridge IDs.
    Label each edge with R for root port, D for designated port, or B for blocked port.
    Assume that port IDs on all bridges run clockwise, starting at 12:00, from high to low.
    That is N > NE > E > SE > S > SW > W > NW, where N stands for north (12:00) and so on.

- question: Describe the different kind of equipment that er being used on the layers
    1, 2, and 3 in a network environment and describe their properties relating to
    collisions and broadcasts.
  answer: |-
    Repeaters and hubs are on layer 1, create one collision domain, single broadcast domain.
    Switches are on layer 2, a single broadcast domain and multiple collision domains.
    Router on layer 3, all ports different broadcast domains (forms a boundary between broadcast domains, multiple collision domains)
- question: What is the structure of the IPv6 header? How are the options implemented in IPv6?
  answer: |-

    Options are implemented with the next header field with which you can link different headers together.
- question: ""
  answer: |
    2q = p + 32p = 2q - 32
- question: |-
    If you subdivide a /17 network into multiple /27 subnetworks, how many possible subnets do you get (excluding subnet zero and the all-ones subnet) and how many possible hosts in each subnet?
    A /p network is subdivided into multiple /q subnetworks in such a way that the number of available subnets is exactly the same as the maximum number of hosts in each subnet.
    Express p as a function of q.
  answer: |
    /17 = 32768/27 = 32 = 30 usable host addresses in each /27 subnet
    2<sup>15</sup>/2<sup>5</sup> = 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 = 1024 -2 = 1022 usable subnets
    2q = p + 32p = 2q - 32
