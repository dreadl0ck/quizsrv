    Consider 4 bridges and 3 LAN segments.
    Bridge Bi with bridge ID i is connected to LAN segment Lj on a port with port ID j for all pairs <i, j> in the set {<1,2>,<1,3>,<2,3>,<2,1>,<3,1>,<3,2>,<4,1>,<4,2>,<4,2>}.
    Illustrate the result of the run of the Spanning Tree Protocol with a graph in which edges are labeled with R for root port, D for designated port, and B for blocked port.

- question: What is the IPv6 network with the largest prefix length that includes
    2015:810:8088::/45, 2015:810:80a0::/44, and 2015:810:80bc::/46
  answer: |-
    88 = 1000100|0a0 = 101000|00bc = 1011110|0
    To include these all, you have to cut off after 10, which means a prefix of 2015:810:8080::/40.
    Note that this is a summary, not an aggregation.
- question: What is the IPv4 prefix corresponding to all class A networks aggregated?

- question: In the (obsolete) subnetting scheme with non-contiguous subnet masks,
    how many subnetworks and how many hosts in each subnetwork are available when
    we subnet the network 99.88.0.0/16 with the subnet mask 255.255.99.88?
  answer: |-
    99 = 0110001188 = 01011000
    This means 62 subnets with 254 hosts
- question: Explain how a bipartite graph can be used as a model for networking
  answer: |-
