  answer: |
    - Greetings (Hello packets) are sent out
    - Both ends will become adjacent

- question: How does link state propagation work on broadcast and NBMA networks?
  answer: |
    - Send out Hello packets: via multicast if possible, for NBMA: use manual list of neighbors
    - Not all neighbors will become adjacent: only those that are neighbors in the virtual topology, one of the adjacent routers is always (B)DR

- question: What can you say about the period of LSP announcements
  answer: |
    Long period (LSRefreshTime param), which is 30 minutes.
    This differs from RIP, which uses 30 seconds.

- question: When are OSPF updates sent?
  answer: As soon as there are topology changes, for example a new neighbor, link or node failure or a change of link cost.

- question: Why is ordinary flooding considered problematic?

- question: What does smart flooding refer to?
  answer: The detection of duplicate link state packets and causing the propagation to be tree like.

- question: Can LSPs arrive out of order?
  answer: Yes

- question: What mechanisms are available to recognize earlier LSPs?
  answer: |
    - Timestamps: bad option, would require clocks to sync

  answer: They can wrap around (happened in ARPANET)
