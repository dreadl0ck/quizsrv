- question: What is an issue with split horizon (in the context of counting to infinity)?
  answer: |-
    In a mesh of A, B and C, where only A is connected to network N, when the link A-N fails, B or C might still advertise the router to N to A.
    Because B might hear the route from A, and B might tell C, C might think it has a route to N via B.
    If B simply doesn't advertise back to the advertiser (A), and C does not advertise back to B, then still, C might advertise the route to A.

- question: What are solutions for counting to infinity?
  answer: Split horizon and Poison(ed) reverse

- question: What is split horizon (in relation to "counting to infinity")?
  answer: Not advertising back to the advertiser.

- question: What is poisoned reverse?
  answer: |
    B reports infinite distance to N back to A in case the link from B to N goes down, and A is behind B from N's point of view.

- question: In Bellman-Ford as applied for RIP, what type of target is being used?
  answer: |
    A fixed target.
    The algorithm takes in a target and varies the source, by listening to annoucements of neighbors.

- question: In Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm one uses?
  answer: A varying source and fixed targets.

- question: Which algorithm uses a forest of trees to construct a minimum spanning tree?
  answer: |
    Kruskal.
    Runs in parallel and joins all the subtrees into a single one.

- question: Name two algorithms that calculate a minimum spanning tree
  answer: Kruskal and Prim

- question: What information is distributed by the RIP protocol?
  answer: |
    Prefixes, gateways and metrics inside the routing table
    But gateway information is not distributed.
    So the answer is: Prefixes and metrics.

- question: Which timer is not specified in an RFC?
  answer: |
    Hold-on timer.
    Was added by Cisco later on, to avoid spreading invalid routing information.

- question: VLSM and CIDR are supported by which protocol?
  answer: Both together are only supported in EIGRP.

- question: Which RIPv2-extension of RIPv1 was added as a hack?
  answer: |
    Authentication.
    Stored in the first routing entry.
