- question: What is an issue with split horizon (in the context of counting to infinity)?
  answer: |-
    In a mesh of A, B and C, where only A is connected to network N, when the link A-N fails, B or C might still advertise the router to N to A.
    Because B might hear the route from A, and B might tell C, C might think it has a route to N via B.
    If B simply doesn't advertise back to the advertiser (A), and C does not advertise back to B, then still, C might advertise the route to A.
