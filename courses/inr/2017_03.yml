- question: Why is IBGP scaling needed?
  answer: |+
    IBGP needs a full mesh in order to work.


- question: What attribute was introduced later to communicate preferences to your
    upstream or to receie extra routing information from your upstream?
  answer: Communities
- question: Which classical attribute is used to prevent your upstream to use hot
    potato routing? Is this always succesful?
  answer: MEDs can be used but it depends on what your neighbor has as local preference.

    Draw the result of the Dijkstra algorithm in the following graph, starting from the source node 'a'.
    Label the nodes 'b', 'c', 'd', ...
    In the order of addition to the shortest path tree and make the dotted lines solid for edges belonging to this shortest path tree.
    Note that each undirected edge may be used in both directions.
    Indicate clearly the direction you use in your drawing.

- question: What information in RIPv2 is disguised as a 'fake route update'?
  answer: Authentication?????
- question: How does RIPv2 use multicast? And RIPng?
  answer: |
    RIPv2 from RFC2453:


        4.5 Multicasting
        In order to reduce unnecessary load on those hosts which are not    listening to RIP-2 messages, an IP multicast address will be used for periodic broadcasts.
    The IP multicast address is 224.0.0.9.
    Note    that IGMP is not needed since these are inter-router messages which    are not forwarded.
        On NBMA networks, unicast addressing may be used.
    However, if a    response addressed to the RIP-2 multicast address is received, it    should be accepted.
        In order to maintain backwards compatibility, the use of the    multicast address will be configurable, as described in section 5.1.    If multicasting is used, it should be used on all interfaces which    support it.
    RIPng uses FF02::9 for multicast.
- question: Why isn't the gateway part of the RIPv1 information? How is the gateway
    information obtained in RIP?
  answer: |-
    Gateway is specific to a certain node, therefore it would not make sense to other nodes.
    Gateway used in the next hop.
