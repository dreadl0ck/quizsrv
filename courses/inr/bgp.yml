- question: Is it wise to advertise customer routes to providers and peers?
  answer: |
    Yes.
    The customer pays for the traffic.

- question: Is it wise to advertise all routes to customers?
  answer: |-
    Yes.
    The customer pays for the traffic.

- question: Is it wise to advertise provider or peer routes to other providers or peers?
  answer: |-
    No.
    Outgoing route advertisements attract incoming traffic for which you have to pay.

- question: What is the order of preference for incoming route advertisements?
  answer: |
    1: Customers (the customer pays for traffic to and from)
    2: Peers (the cost for the connection is generally split between the peers)
    3: Providers (traffic to and from the provider costs money)


- question: What is a peer? (in the context of customers and providers)
  answer: A horizontal relation between two neighbors that allows traffic to flow
    between them without going trough the providers.

- question: What is the relation between a customer and a provider?
  answer: |-
    A provider provides his customers with access to networks that are not otherwise connected to the customer.
    The customer pays the provider for traffic to and from the provider.

  answer: To exchange route prefixes between different ASs, and to implement routing policies.

- question: What is iBGP used for?
  answer: |
    Used for BGP neighbors within one and the same AS, in order to create a consistent view among all nodes and to insert locally originated prefixes.

- question: Are routes imported from one iBGP peer distributed to another iBGP peer?
  answer: |
    No! This is done to prevent possible routing loops.
    Loop detection is based on duplicates in AS paths: iBGP cannot detect this.
