    If a certain autonomous system has 4 external BGP peerings, what can you say about the number of internal BGP peerings?
    Suppose no use is made of route reflectors or other optimalisations.
  answer: 4 routers have to be configured in full mesh, which means 6 peerings.

- question: What is the fundamental difference between RIP and OSPF as far as theoretical
    foundation of these routing protocols is concerned?
  answer: |-
    With OSPF, every router has to know the whole topology.
    Every router also computes the best routes for themselves.

- question: What fields are added to an ethernet frame to support VLANs?
  answer: |
    VLAN Type (2 bytes, 0x8100)
    CFI (1 bit, ethernet/token ring)

- question: |-
    Consider the subnet of the IPv6 space given by the union of the prefixes ::/2, 8000::/2, 4000::/3, 6000::/3, c000::/4, and d000::/4.
    Describe this same subnet as the union of prefixes with the maximum possible aggregation.
  answer: |+
    ::/2      = 00
    8000::/2  = 10
    4000::/3  = 010
    6000::/3  = 011
    c000::/4  = 1100
    d000::/4  = 1101
    First, d000/4 and c000/4 is aggregated into 110 = c000::/3
    4000::/3 and 6000::/3 is aggregated into 01 = 4000::/2
    Second, 4000::/2 can be aggregated with ::/2 which becomes ::/1
    We end up with the following addresses:
    ::/1, 8000::/2, and c000::/3

- question: |-
    Consider four routers (R1, R2, R3, and R4).
    There is a point-to point link P12 between R1 and R2, P23 between R2 and R3, P34 between R3 and R4 and P41 between R4 and R1.
    All routers share a LAN L, which also contains the host H.
    Draw a bipartite graph representing this situation.
