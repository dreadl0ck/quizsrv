- question: How can one set the next hop in RIPng?
  answer: |-
    Put the next hop in place of the prefix and fill the remaining fields (route tag, prefix length and metric) with 0x0000, 0x00 and 0xff.
    The prefixes following will use this next hop.
    One can reset the next hop using ::
- question: What is the packet format of RIPng?
  answer: |-
    Length in bytes; value1; command (1=request, 2=response)
    1; version (=1, because it's the first version of the new protocol RIPng)
    2; reserved (must be 0)
    16; IPv6 prefix2; route tag
    1; prefix length (number of bits that is the network portion)
    1; metric (16=inf)
    Fields `prefix` through `metric` can be repeated
- question: What destination address does RIPng use?
  answer: ff02::9, the all-rip-routers mcast address.
- question: What's the maximum length of RIPng packets?
  answer: Any length that fits inside the network unfragmented
- question: What feature did RIPng remove?
  answer: Authentication, since that can be done at IP level with IPv6.
- question: What protocol stack does RIPng use?
  answer: IPv6 -> UDP port 521
- question: What is the destination of RIPv2 packets?
  answer: |
    The broadcast address was replaced by a multicast address, the same as EIGRP: 224.0.0.9 (which is not forwarded)
- question: What is the Next Hop field for in RIPv2?
  answer: Used when best next hop does not speak RIP itself
- question: What does each hop do with the route tag field of RIPv2 and what is its
    purpose?
  answer: |-
    It is simply carried along.
    It diffrentiates between internally and externally generated routes.
- question: How does authentication work in RIPv2?
  answer: |-
    AFI is set to 0xFFFF, followed by the authentication type (2 bytes) and then the authentication data follows.
    Auth type 2 is plaintext password, type 3 means use of some crypto.
- question: What's the packet format of RIPv2?
  answer: |-
    Bytes; value1; command (1=request, 2=response)
    1; version (=2)
    2; Reserved (must be 0)
    2; Address Family Identifier (=2=IP)
    2; Route Tag (identification of route origin)
    4; IP address (network)
    4; Subnet Mask (CIDR support)
    4; Next Hop (gateway, if different from advertising router)
    4; Metric (16=inf)
    The fields after (not including) reserved, can be repeated up to 25 times.
- question: What does RIPv2 have extensions for?
  answer: |
    - Subnet masks
    - Alternate next hop
    - Authentication
    - Multicasting
    - Route tags
- question: What are some advantages of EIGRP?
  answer: |
    - It uses partial and incremental updates when the routing table changes.
    - It uses hello multicast packets to discover neighbors (IP 224.0.0.10).
    - It uses ACKs for reliable communication.
    - It can summarize on arbitrary bit boundaries (classless).
- question: What algorithm does EIGRP use?
  answer: DUAL, for loop-free routing and fast convergence.
- question: What is EIGRP?
  answer: |-
    Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol.
    Also Cisco proprietary, but in RFC 7868 for informational purposes.
    It runs as protocol 88 on top of IP.
- question: What metrics does IGRP communicate to neighbors?
  answer: |-
    A composite metric, based on delay, bandwidth, reliability and load.
    The hop count is still communicated as a separate field to see when infinity has been reached.
    It also communicates MTU information about the path.
- question: What types of routes does IGRP have?
  answer: Interior (with implicit subnet information, like RIPv1), system route (which
    is possibly summarized), and exterior (acting as a configured candidate default).
- question: What are autonomous systems in IGRP?
  answer: |-
    Independent domains.
    Not the same as IANA-registered ASes.
    IGRP autonomous systems are connected together with static (or redistributed) routes.
- question: What is IGRP?
  answer: |-
    Interior Gateway Routing Protocol, by Cisco.
    Uses a distance vector protocol.
    Basically same as RIP, except it runs on top of IP (protocol 9), has a larger notion of infinity (typically 100, max 255) and accepts up to 4 parallel paths.

- question: What's in a RIPv1 packet?
  answer: |-
    Length in bytes; contents:
    1; Command (request=1, response=2)
    1; Version (=1)
    2; Reserved (0)
    2; Address Family Identifier (=2 for IP)
    2; Reserved (0)
    4; IP address (network)
    8; Reserved (0)
    4; Metric (max 16=infinity)
    The fields after (not including) the first reserved field, can be repeated at most 25 times.
- question: What is the maximum size of a RIPv1 packet and how many updates fit in
    there?
  answer: 512 bytes, fits 25 route updates (each update is 20 bytes)
- question: What's the port/proto for RIPv1?
  answer: 520/udp
- question: Where are RIPv1 packets sent towards?
  answer: Towards IP 255.255.255.255, or to a directed broadcast address, or to an individual host or router as a response to a request.
- question: What timers does RIPv1 have, what's a default, and what do they do?
  answer: |-
    Update timer: interval between sending updates.
    Default 30 seconds.
    Invalid timer: if no updates are received for a route within <time>, set hop count to infinity.
    Default 180 seconds.
    Flush timer AKA garbage-collection timer: remove routes after they have been invalid for a while.
    Default: 240 seconds.
    Hold-down timer: Cisco's addition, does not accept updates during hold-down on routes that have been marked unreachable.
    Default: 180 seconds.
- question: How long does it take for information to spread through a network using RIPv1?
  answer: Each router will send its neighbors updates every 30 seconds (by default),
    thus it depends on how many routers and when their timer expires.
- question: What is a disadvantage of poisoned reverse?
  answer: Larger routing update packets
- question: What measures does RIPv1 take against counting to infinity?
  answer: Both split horizon and poisoned reverse.
- question: What is the basic operation of RIPv1?
  answer: |-
    It keeps a table of routes to destination networks, keeping the distance (metric) and gateway (next hop).
    It periodically sends out this table (sans gateways) to all neighbors.
    It will update the table with newly collected information (metric can only decrease, unless the information comes from the gateway itself and it overrides old information).
- question: What is the maximum hop distance of RIP?
  answer: |-
    15 hops, i.e.
    16 == infinity

  answer: Interior Routing Protocol

- question: Is RIP an IGP?
  answer: Yes.

- question: What algorithm is RIPv1 based on?
  answer: Bellman-Ford distance vector algorithm
