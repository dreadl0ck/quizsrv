- question: How does a BGP speaker see the difference between an EBGP and an IBGP
    session? What is the name of the message that reveals this information? What is
    the difference between EBGP and IBGP with respect to loop prevention?
  answer: |-
    IBGP will have the same AS number. This is specified in the OPEN message.
    <img src="/files/anki/paste-29764123361281.jpg" />
    When BGP updates travel through different Autonomous Systems (AS), EBGP routers prepend their AS to AS PATH attribute.
    BGP routers use this information to check through which Autonomous Systems certain updates passed.
    If a EBGP speaking router detects its own AS in AS PATH attribute update, the router will ignore the update and will not advertise it further to IBGP neighbors, because it is a routing information loop.
    This is a built in mechanism for loop prevention in BGP.
    To avoid routing information loops within the same AS, all IBGP routers must peer with every router within AS (only TCP sessions required, not physical connections) â€“ this is called full mesh IBGP.
    IBGP uses split horizon rule (covered in other article), which states that routes learned from one IBGP neighbor is never sent to the rest of IBGP neighbors.
    That way, when you have full mesh IBGP, routing information loops will not occur, because all routers have the same routing information.

    Draw a graph of all adjacencies in a LAN with five routers.
    How many adjacencies are there? What is the difference between the DR and BDR as far as LSAs are concerned?
  answer: |
    Everyone becomes adjacent to DR and BDR, so 10 adjacencies.
    Only DR sends out LSA?

    Suppose a RIP based network has a tree form.
    What can you do to avoid counting to infinity? What happens when one link fails?
    Now suppose the network has a ring shape.

  answer: |-
    <img src="/files/anki/paste-23789823852545.jpg" />
    When one link fails, the network splits into two?
    For a ring, you can only use the 'infinity is finite' or 'poisoned reverse' solutions due to the reason below.

- question: |-
    Draw an IPv6 address space tree and indicate the three subtrees for special addresses, the global unicast addresses and multicast addresses.
    Also indicate the reserved addresses (outside ::/3 and E000::/3) with as much aggregation as possible.
  answer: |-
    From a previous question (2017_03 deck):
    <img src="/files/anki/paste-30588757082113.jpg" />
    C = 01 = 4000::/2 = Reserved?
    B = 001 = 2000::/3 = Global Unicast
    A = 00000000 = ::/8 = Reserved by IETF
    D = 1111110 = FC::/7 = Unique Local Addresses
    F = 11111111 = FF::/8 = Multicast
    E = 1111111010 = FE8::/10 = Link-Scoped Unicast
- question: What is the minimal and maximal size of an IPv4 header? Explain.
  answer: |
    <img src="/files/anki/paste-2259152797697.jpg" />
    Note that size is in 32-bit words (so not bytes).
    5 * 32 = 160 bits = 20 bytes
    15 * 32 = 480 bits = 60 bytes
    Minimal 5 because you need to have all the required fields.
    Maximum 15 if you include all the options (given below)

- question: If you subnet at /17 network in multiple /22 networks how many subnets
    do you get (without counting subnet zero or the all-ones subnet) and how many hosts in each subnet?
    What confusing could arise if you would allow subnet zero and the all-ones subnet?
  answer: |
    /17 = 32768
    /22 = 1024 = 1024 - 2 = 1022 usable hosts
    2<sup>15</sup>/2<sup>10</sup> = 2<sup>5</sup> = 32 = 32 -2 = 30 usable subnets
    Traditionally, it was strongly recommended that subnet zero and the all-ones subnet not be used for addressing.
    According to RFC 950 leavingcisco.com: 'It is useful to preserve and extend the interpretation of these special (network and broadcast) addresses in subnetted networks. This means the values of all zeros and all ones in the subnet field should not be assigned to actual (physical) subnets.'
