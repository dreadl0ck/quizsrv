- question: What's a VLAN?
  answer: |-
    Virtual LAN, where LAN stands for Local Area Network.
    The ethertype is 0x8100.
    It separates a physically bridged LAN into multiple logical/virtual LANs.
- question: What's a no-frill?
  answer: |-
    A stupid switch, which just copies frames to separate the collision domain.
    Uses store and forward technique.
    The opposite is a learning and filtering switch/bridge, which remembers on which port a station resides.
    This builds a filtering database.
- question: What are common ethernet types?
  answer: 0x800 for IP, 0x806 for ARP and 0x86DD for IPv6
- question: |-
    TODO slide 17 you can't do the reverse of a flip
    why set the bit to universal when you locally administer it
    why skip bits 64-71 when creating a ... a what?
  answer: ""
- question: How to put a MAC address, ahem, EUI-64 in an IPv6 address?
  answer: |-
    Flip the U/L bit (from 0 to 1 in the example).
    Locally assigned IPv6 addresses do the reverse.
- question: How can one embed an MAC-48 in EUI-64?
  answer: |-
    Paste FF:FF in the middle:
    00:30:65:7E:9D:5E ⇒ 00:30:65:FF:FF:7E:9D:5E
    But since they are obsolete, you can really just do whatever and could paste FF:FE in there as well.
- question: How can one embed an EUI-48 in EUI-64?
  answer: |
    Paste FF:FE in the middle:
    00:30:65:7E:9D:5E ⇒ 00:30:65:FF:FE:7E:9D:5E
- question: What bits are special in a MAC address?
  answer: I/G bit (individual/group) and U/L (universal/local), the first and second
    bit on the wire because it is sent in LSB format (least significant bit first),
    or the last two bits of the first byte.
- question: What is the OUI?
  answer: Orginizationally Unique Identifier
- question: What's the minimum and maximum size of a PDU in DIX Ethernet?
  answer: |
    46 - 1500 bytes
- question: What does the DIX Ethernet / Ethernet II header look like?
  answer: |2-
    - 7 bytes preamble, 1 byte Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)
    - Destination and source address (2×6 bytes)
    - Type (2 bytes)
    - PDU (perhaps with padding)
    - FCS (CRC)
- question: What fields does LLC introduce?
  answer: |-
    DSAP, SSAP and a control byte.
    SAP stands for Service Access Point and D/S for destination/source.
- question: Which sublayers does layer 2 have?
  answer: |-
    MAC (Media Access Control) and LLC (Logical Link Control).
    MAC is the lower one and its most important example is Ethernet with CSMA/CD.
    Ethernet also controle backoff and retransmission.
    LLC introduces new fields (see another card).
- question: What is the difference between hubs and switches, or between repeaters
    and bridges?
  answer: A repeater has a single collision domain; a bridge has a single broadcast
    domain.
- question: What forms a LAN/link?
  answer: A network connected by bridges and/or switches.
- question: What forms a LAN/link segment?
  answer: |-
    A network connectd by hubs and/or repeaters.
    Notably *not* switches.
- question: At which layer does a hub operate and what is another word for it?
  answer: Physical; multiport repeater.
